# Python Version Requirement:
# Python 3.11 is REQUIRED for this project. No other Python versions are supported.
# The Hailo TPU integration specifically requires Python 3.11 with the included
# hailort-4.20.0-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl package.
#
# Note on Python version compatibility:
# The included Hailo SDK wheel file is for Python 3.11. If you're using a different Python version,
# you may need to download the appropriate wheel file from the Hailo Developer Zone.
#
# See docs/raspberry_pi_hailo_setup.md for detailed instructions.
