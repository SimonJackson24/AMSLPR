# AMSLPR Deployment Checklist

This checklist is designed to help you deploy the AMSLPR system in a production environment. Follow these steps to ensure a successful deployment.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review hardware requirements
  - [ ] Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM recommended)
  - [ ] Camera (Raspberry Pi Camera Module, USB camera, or ONVIF IP camera)
  - [ ] Network connectivity
  - [ ] GPIO connections for barrier control (if applicable)

- [ ] Review software requirements
  - [ ] Raspberry Pi OS (Buster or newer, 64-bit recommended)
  - [ ] Python 3.7 or newer
  - [ ] Required dependencies

- [ ] Prepare deployment environment
  - [ ] Clean installation of Raspberry Pi OS
  - [ ] Network configuration
  - [ ] SSH access enabled
  - [ ] Camera connected and functional

## Installation

- [ ] Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amslpr.git
  cd amslpr
  ```

- [ ] Run the installation script
  ```bash
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

- [ ] Verify installation
  - [ ] Check that all dependencies were installed
  - [ ] Verify that the database was created
  - [ ] Confirm that the systemd service was created and enabled
  - [ ] Check that Nginx was configured correctly

## Configuration

- [ ] Edit the configuration file
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/amslpr/config.json
  ```

- [ ] Configure camera settings
  - [ ] Set camera ID or IP address
  - [ ] Configure frame size and processing interval
  - [ ] Set confidence threshold for license plate detection

- [ ] Configure barrier control (if applicable)
  - [ ] Set GPIO pin for barrier control
  - [ ] Configure open time and safety checks

- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS
  - [ ] Use self-signed certificates or Let's Encrypt
  - [ ] Update SSL paths in configuration

- [ ] Configure security settings
  - [ ] Set rate limiting parameters
  - [ ] Configure failed login protection
  - [ ] Set up user accounts and permissions

- [ ] Configure monitoring and error handling
  - [ ] Set alert thresholds for system resources
  - [ ] Configure error logging
  - [ ] Set up email notifications (if desired)

## Testing

- [ ] Test camera functionality
  - [ ] Verify that the camera feed is accessible
  - [ ] Test license plate recognition
  - [ ] Adjust camera position and settings if needed

- [ ] Test barrier control (if applicable)
  - [ ] Verify that the barrier opens and closes correctly
  - [ ] Test safety features

- [ ] Test web interface
  - [ ] Verify that the web interface is accessible over HTTPS
  - [ ] Test user authentication
  - [ ] Test all major features (vehicle management, logs, statistics, etc.)

- [ ] Test system monitoring
  - [ ] Verify that system statistics are being collected
  - [ ] Test error handling
  - [ ] Verify that notifications are working (if configured)

## Final Steps

- [ ] Set up automated backups
  ```bash
  sudo crontab -e
  ```
  Add a daily backup job (runs at 2 AM):
  ```
  0 2 * * * /opt/amslpr/venv/bin/python /opt/amslpr/src/utils/backup.py > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```

- [ ] Set up log rotation
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/amslpr
  ```
  Add the following configuration:
  ```
  /var/log/amslpr/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 640 root adm
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
      systemctl reload amslpr.service > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
    endscript
  }
  ```

- [ ] Document the deployment
  - [ ] Record hardware configuration
  - [ ] Document software versions
  - [ ] Note any custom configurations
  - [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures

- [ ] Train users
  - [ ] Provide training on the web interface
  - [ ] Document procedures for common tasks
  - [ ] Establish support contacts

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor system performance
  - [ ] Check CPU, memory, and disk usage
  - [ ] Monitor camera performance
  - [ ] Check for error logs

- [ ] Monitor license plate recognition accuracy
  - [ ] Review false positives and false negatives
  - [ ] Adjust confidence threshold if needed
  - [ ] Consider additional training data if needed

- [ ] Perform regular backups
  - [ ] Verify that automated backups are working
  - [ ] Test restore procedures

- [ ] Keep the system updated
  - [ ] Apply security updates
  - [ ] Update the AMSLPR software when new versions are available
