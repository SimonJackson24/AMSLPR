# AMSLPR High Availability and Redundancy Guide

This guide provides strategies for implementing high availability and redundancy in AMSLPR deployments where continuous operation is critical. These configurations are designed to minimize downtime and ensure system reliability.

## Overview

High availability (HA) in AMSLPR can be achieved through several complementary approaches:

1. **Hardware redundancy** - Duplicate hardware components to eliminate single points of failure
2. **Data redundancy** - Ensure data is backed up and can be restored quickly
3. **Network redundancy** - Provide multiple network paths for communication
4. **Power redundancy** - Ensure continuous power supply
5. **Failover mechanisms** - Automatically switch to backup systems when failures occur

## Hardware Redundancy

### Primary-Backup Configuration

The simplest HA setup involves a primary system and a backup system:

1. **Primary system**
   - Handles all normal operations
   - Continuously replicates data to the backup system
   - Sends heartbeat signals to verify operation

2. **Backup system**
   - Remains in standby mode during normal operation
   - Maintains synchronized data with the primary system
   - Takes over operations when the primary system fails

#### Implementation

1. Set up two identical AMSLPR systems
2. Configure database replication between them
3. Implement a heartbeat mechanism to detect failures
4. Create a failover script to activate the backup system

```bash
# Example heartbeat check script (on backup system)
#!/bin/bash
PRIMARY_IP="192.168.1.100"
PRIMARY_PORT="5000"
MAX_FAILURES=3
CHECK_INTERVAL=10

failures=0

while true; do
  if ping -c 1 $PRIMARY_IP > /dev/null || curl -s http://$PRIMARY_IP:$PRIMARY_PORT/api/health > /dev/null; then
    # Primary is responding, reset failure count
    failures=0
    sleep $CHECK_INTERVAL
  else
    # Primary not responding, increment failure count
    failures=$((failures+1))
    
    if [ $failures -ge $MAX_FAILURES ]; then
      # Activate backup system
      echo "Primary system failed. Activating backup system."
      sudo systemctl start amslpr.service
      
      # Notify administrators
      echo "AMSLPR primary system failed. Backup system activated." | mail -s "AMSLPR Failover Alert" admin@example.com
      
      # Exit loop after activation
      break
    fi
    
    sleep $CHECK_INTERVAL
  fi
done
```

### Active-Active Configuration

A more advanced setup involves multiple active systems working simultaneously:

1. **Multiple active nodes**
   - Each node handles a portion of the workload
   - All nodes have access to a shared database
   - Load balancer distributes requests among nodes

2. **Benefits**
   - Higher throughput and performance
   - Automatic failover if one node fails
   - Ability to perform maintenance without downtime

#### Implementation

1. Set up multiple AMSLPR systems
2. Configure a shared database server
3. Install and configure a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy or Nginx)
4. Update the AMSLPR configuration to use the shared database

```bash
# Example HAProxy configuration
global
    log /dev/log local0
    log /dev/log local1 notice
    chroot /var/lib/haproxy
    stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin
    stats timeout 30s
    user haproxy
    group haproxy
    daemon

defaults
    log global
    mode http
    option httplog
    option dontlognull
    timeout connect 5000
    timeout client 50000
    timeout server 50000

frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    stats uri /haproxy?stats
    default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    option httpchk GET /api/health
    server amslpr1 192.168.1.101:5000 check
    server amslpr2 192.168.1.102:5000 check
    server amslpr3 192.168.1.103:5000 check
```

## Data Redundancy

### Database Replication

1. **SQLite with replication**
   - Use tools like `litestream` for continuous replication
   - Replicate to a backup server or cloud storage
   - Automate recovery procedures

```bash
# Install litestream
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/benbjohnson/litestream/releases/latest | \
  grep browser_download_url | \
  grep linux_amd64.tar.gz | \
  cut -d '"' -f 4 | \
  xargs curl -L | \
  tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/litestream /usr/local/bin

# Create litestream configuration
sudo mkdir -p /etc/litestream
sudo nano /etc/litestream/config.yml
```

Example configuration:
```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /var/lib/amslpr/amslpr.db
    replicas:
      - url: file:///mnt/backup/amslpr.db
      - url: s3://mybucket/amslpr.db
        access-key-id: ACCESS_KEY_ID
        secret-access-key: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

2. **Upgrade to a client-server database**
   - For larger deployments, consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - Configure master-slave replication
   - Implement automated failover

### Regular Backups

1. **Scheduled backups**
   - Configure daily or hourly backups
   - Store backups on separate storage
   - Test restoration procedures regularly

```bash
# Create backup script
sudo nano /opt/amslpr/scripts/backup.sh
```

Example backup script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backup/amslpr"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
DB_PATH="/var/lib/amslpr/amslpr.db"
CONFIG_PATH="/etc/amslpr"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Create database backup
sqlite3 $DB_PATH ".backup '$BACKUP_DIR/amslpr_$TIMESTAMP.db'"

# Compress database backup
gzip $BACKUP_DIR/amslpr_$TIMESTAMP.db

# Backup configuration files
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/config_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz $CONFIG_PATH

# Remove backups older than 30 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "amslpr_*.db.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "config_*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

2. **Off-site backups**
   - Replicate backups to a remote location
   - Use cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
   - Encrypt sensitive data before transfer

## Network Redundancy

### Dual Network Connections

1. **Multiple network interfaces**
   - Configure both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections
   - Set up automatic failover between interfaces
   - Use different ISPs for true redundancy

```bash
# Install network management tools
sudo apt install ifupdown ifplugd

# Configure network interfaces
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Example configuration:
```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-ssid "YourWiFiNetwork"
  wpa-psk "YourWiFiPassword"
  metric 100  # Higher metric means lower priority
```

2. **Network bonding**
   - Combine multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface
   - Provides both redundancy and increased bandwidth
   - Configure in active-backup or load-balancing mode

```bash
# Install bonding kernel module
sudo apt install ifenslave

# Load bonding module
sudo modprobe bonding

# Configure bonding
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Example bonding configuration:
```
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet dhcp
  bond-slaves eth0 eth1
  bond-mode active-backup
  bond-miimon 100
  bond-primary eth0
```

### Network Monitoring and Failover

1. **Continuous monitoring**
   - Monitor network connectivity and performance
   - Automatically switch to backup connections when needed
   - Send alerts when network issues are detected

2. **VPN connectivity**
   - Use VPN for secure remote access
   - Configure multiple VPN endpoints for redundancy
   - Implement automatic reconnection

## Power Redundancy

```

Example configuration:
```
UPSNAME AMSLPR_UPS
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
DEVICE /dev/ttyUSB0
BATTERYLEVEL 30

   - Configure automatic restart for failed services
   - Set appropriate restart limits and delays
   - Monitor service status and send alerts

```bash
# Edit systemd service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/amslpr.service
```

Add these lines to the `[Service]` section:
```
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
StartLimitInterval=60s
StartLimitBurst=3
```

2. **Application-level recovery**
   - Implement error handling and recovery in the application code
   - Use transactions for database operations
   - Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies

### Automatic Failover

1. **IP failover**
   - Use floating IP addresses that can move between systems

   - Configure DNS with low TTL for quick updates

```bash
# Install keepalived for IP failover
sudo apt install keepalived

# Configure keepalived
sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
```

Example configuration (primary node):
```
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass securepassword
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.200/24
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing high availability for AMSLPR requires careful planning and consideration of hardware, software, network, and power redundancy. By eliminating single points of failure and implementing automatic failover mechanisms, you can achieve near-continuous operation even in the face of component failures.

Remember that high availability is not just about technology—it also involves processes, testing, and ongoing maintenance. Regular testing and validation of your HA setup is essential to ensure it will work when needed.

For mission-critical deployments, consider engaging with experts in high availability systems to design and implement a solution tailored to your specific requirements and constraints.
